# Stock Analysis Project

## Project Overview
As a Data Scientist or Data Analyst at a startup investment firm, your task is to extract financial data, including historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, using Python libraries and web scraping. The stocks analyzed include Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. The data will be visualized in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends.

## Dashboard Analytics
A dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs). This project involves:
- Extracting stock data
- Analyzing key performance metrics
- Displaying results in a dashboard using Plotly

## Tools and Platforms
- **Skills Network Labs** – A sandbox environment for hands-on labs
- **Watson Studio** – A collaborative environment for data science and AI development

## Project Components
- **Two hands-on labs**: Extracting stock data
- **One assignment**: Creating a dashboard
- **Assessment**: Two quizzes and one peer review assignment

## Understanding Stocks
A stock (equity) represents ownership in a corporation, entitling the holder to a proportion of the corporation’s assets and profits. Stock prices fluctuate based on various factors such as outstanding shares and company profitability.

This project uses the **y-finance API** to extract stock ticker information and analyze stock trends.

## GameStop vs. Tesla Stock Analysis
- **Stock Pricing Factors**: Stock prices are influenced by profits and investor speculation.
- **Short Selling**: Investors profit from falling stock prices by borrowing and selling stocks, then repurchasing them at a lower price.
- **Tesla Case**: Initially targeted by short sellers, Tesla's increasing profitability led to a stock price surge.
- **GameStop Case**: A surge in stock price driven by retail investors on Reddit’s WallStreetBets led to losses for hedge funds with short positions.

## Objective
As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, you will extract and compare Tesla and GameStop’s profit data, analyzing stock performance for investment decision-making.
